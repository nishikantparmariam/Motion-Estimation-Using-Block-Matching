# Motion-Estimation-Using-Block-Matching

#### Python implementation of Block Matching algorithm using 'Full Search' that estimates motion between two consecutive frames of a video sequence using.

The output of the algorithm are white points denoting the start points and black points denoting the end points of motion vectors in frame 2.

This project was part of the course ES203 : Digital Systems offered at IIT Gandhinagar in year 2019-20 (Semester-3).
