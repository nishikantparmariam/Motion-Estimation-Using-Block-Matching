# Motion-Estimation-Using-Block-Matching

#### Python implementation of Block Matching algorithm using 'Full Search' that estimates motion between two consecutive frames of a video sequence using.

The output of the algorithm are white points denoting the start points and black points denoting the end points of motion vectors in frame 2.
